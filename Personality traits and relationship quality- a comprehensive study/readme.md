Research problem: Understanding the relationship between personality traits and relationship quality in romantic partnerships.\

Objectives:
- To examine the association between the Big Five personality traits and relationship quality.
- To identify which personality traits are most predictive of high relationship satisfaction.
- To explore how different combinations of personality traits affect relationship quality.\

Hypothesis: 
- H1: Higher levels of Agreeableness and Conscientiousness will positively correlate with relationship satisfaction. 
- H2: Higher levels of Neuroticism will negatively correlate with relationship satisfaction. 
- H3: Openness to Experience and Extraversion will show varied correlations with relationship satisfaction based on their interaction with shared interests and social compatibility.\

Tests/Tools for Data Collection:\
Big Five Inventory (BFI), Couples Satisfaction Index (CSI-32)
  
Detailed Data Analysis:\
Data Cleaning, Summarize the scores of the BFI and CSI-32 (means, standard deviations). Create histograms or box 
plots to visualize the distribution of the scores. Compute Pearson correlation coefficients/Spearman’s 
coefficients between the Big Five personality traits and relationship quality (CSI-32 scores). Interpret 
the strength and direction of the correlations (e.g., r > 0.50 indicates a strong positive correlation). Run 
the regression analysis to identify significant predictors. Evaluate the model fit using R² (coefficient of 
determination).
